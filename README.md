## 👋 The Journey

I started coding at 14. Not because of school or a bootcamp—just pure curiosity and an Arduino kit.

**18 years later**, that curiosity has taken me from designing PCBs in Damascus to **finishing 9th in the World Robot Olympiad** against 70 countries, from teaching 200+ university students during challenging times to **winning IBM's Call for Code**, from leading dev teams in Barcelona to building Spring Boot microservices in Spain.

I'm not a frontend developer who learned backend, or a backend developer who dabbles in hardware. I'm a **builder** who started at the metal and worked up to the cloud—and I'm equally comfortable at every layer in between.

> **Current mission:** Architecting scalable backend systems at Bruker while staying rooted in the hardware and robotics that started it all.
